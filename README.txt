MusiChat Social Media Website - HU Project 2 Assignment - Quintin Hurrell

MusiChat is a social media platform that is designed for musicians. The website is made
so that the user can look up names of musicians/artists that they are interested in, and then see the feed
that that person has created. It is supposed to function like a Reddit type website, except
with individual accounts, instead of full communities. During the end of the imlementation phase, I started to
look at it as a LinkedIn for musicians.

This website was developed using Flask for its prototype, Django during implementation, and Free Code Camp's Social_book Template.

After Completion:

As of right now, a user can; Create an Account, Like posts, Create Posts, Search for Musicians, Follow Musicians, and Edit their Profile.

In the future I would like to add a Messenger-like app, Real time Commenting, Live-Streamed Concerts, Better UI, Bug Fixes, and a Hashtag System


Hope you all enjoy MusiChat! I learned a lot during this process!
