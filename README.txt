MusiChat Social Media Website - HU Project 2 Assignment - Quintin Hurrell

MusiChat is a social media platform that is designed for musicians. The website is made
so that the user can look up names of people tha tthey are interested in, and then see the feed
that that person has created. It is supposed to function like a Reddit type website, except
with individual accounts, instead of full communities.

This website was developed use Flask at it's start, Django during implementation, and Free Code Camp's Social Template.

Main Resources:

After Completion:

As of right now, a user can; Create an Account, Like posts, Create Posts, Search for Musicians, Follow Musicians, and Edit their Profile.

In the future I would like to add a Messenger-like app, Real time Commenting, Live-Streamed Concerts, Better UI, Bug Fixes, and a Hashtag System


Hope you all enjoy MusiChat! I learned a lot during this process!
